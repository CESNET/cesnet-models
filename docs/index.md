# CESNET Models

This is documentation of the [CESNET Models](https://github.com/CESNET/cesnet-models) project. 

The goal of this project is to provide neural network architectures for traffic classification and their pre-trained weights. The weights were trained using public datasets available in the [CESNET DataZoo](https://github.com/CESNET/cesnet-datazoo) package.

The newest network architecture is named Multi-modal CESNET v2 (mm-CESNET-v2) and is visualized in the following picture. See the [getting started][getting-started] page and [models][available-models] reference for more information.
