# CESNET Models

This is the documentation of the [CESNET Models](https://github.com/CESNET/cesnet-models) project. 

The goal of this project is to provide pre-trained neural networks for traffic classification in a similar fashion to what torchvision is doing for the computer vision field.

**Models from the following papers are included:**

* [Fine-grained TLS services classification with reject option](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2022.109467) <br>
Jan Luxemburk and Tomáš Čejka <br>
Computer Networks

* [Encrypted traffic classification: the QUIC case](https://doi.org/10.1016/10.23919/TMA58422.2023.10199052) <br>
Jan Luxemburk and Karel Hynek <br>
